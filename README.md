### Hey there! 👋
I'm Matthew, and you find yourself on my GitHub profile. That likely means that you're interested in my work! My pinned repos merely scratch the surface of the work I've completed over the past few years. My professional software development is within private corporate repositories, however there is plenty to showcase my skills from my recently completed undergraduate computer science from the University of Greenwich in which I awarded a First-Class Honours grade.

Feel free to have a look around my projects, all pinned repos are from my degree in which I earned a First-Class Honours grade.

Do feel free to contact me, I'm always up for a chat!<br>
