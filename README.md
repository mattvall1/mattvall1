### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Matt, and you find yourself on my GitHub profile. That likely means that you're interested in my work! My pinned repos merely scratch the surface of the work I've completed over the past few years. My professional code is stored in private repositories; however, I have a wealth of material to showcase my skills from my recently completed undergraduate computer science degree from the University of Greenwich, for which I was awarded a First-Class Honors grade.
